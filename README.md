# General terms microservice
This service is designed for providing PDF documents for my freelancing general terms.

#### Goal
The goal is to host this project at https://basvandriel.nl/legal-pdf-microservice-gh-pages/.

### Findings
- When using GitHub pages, we are only allowed to use static content. Placing an `index.pdf` file in the root unforunately does not work. When we are able to move to a dedicated server, this can be possible.
